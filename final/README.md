Repo for my final project of the semester

Execution command: bin/main -t southern_rockies.txt -l mylogfile.txt

This program processes a file with data about average temperatures per month in the Southern Rockies, though any region will do. It outputs the data from the file into various html files which show visualizations of the data using google charts api across a few different metrics.
